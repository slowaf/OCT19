Hello my dear codechef I want to tell you why I did this.
Long challenges are superb way of learning , but things are not going as it ought to be. Peole have so much time that they cheat in these contest, and who pays off ,someone like me who work his assof to solve problems.  And you think you can catch cheaters by Plagiarism oh seriously ? Changing variable names including unknown functions, and your MOSS become as dumb as you. Just make the contest go unrated not only this but all of coming long challenges. But you have nothing to do with this, you just want participation, and you are getting that,You do your part I will do mine.

<PEACE/>
